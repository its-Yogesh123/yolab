YoLab is a `multi-service SaaS` platform that provides various useful web tools such as a QR Code Generator and a URL Shortener under one unified interface.

The goal of YoLab is to offer multiple lightweight services in one platform while maintaining a scalable architecture that can later evolve into microservices using the Strangler Pattern.

## Introduction

YoLab is designed as a modular monolith application where each service (QR generator, URL shortener, etc.) is implemented as an independent module inside a single backend.  
The frontend is built with React and provides a common user interface for all services.

This design allows easy migration to microservices in the future without major rewrites.

## Goals

YoLab aims to evolve from a multi-tool web application into a scalable startup-style platform for digital utilities.

### Short-Term Goals
- Build and stabilize core services such as the QR Code Generator and URL Shortener.  
- Provide a clean and consistent user interface across all tools.  
- Maintain a modular monolith architecture that is easy to extend and refactor.  
- Ensure good performance and reliability for everyday use cases.

### Mid-Term Goals
- Introduce a centralized authentication system for single sign-on (SSO).  
- Add more independent services such as image processing, file conversion, and data utilities.  
- Improve developer experience with well-defined APIs and documentation.  
- Begin migrating selected modules into independent microservices using the Strangler Pattern.

### Long-Term Goals (Startup Vision)
- Transform YoLab into a full-fledged multi-service SaaS platform.  
- Support independent scaling of services through a microservices architecture.  
- Provide APIs that can be used by external developers and businesses.  
- Build a sustainable product ecosystem around small, high-utility digital tools.  
- Establish YoLab as a reliable and extensible utility platform for the web.

> YoLab is envisioned not only as a technical project but as a foundation for a future startup focused on productivity and web utilities.
